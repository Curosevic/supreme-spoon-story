There once was a college student named Jeff. Jeff is a sophmore studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin. Jeff has midterms next week but is totally unprepaired. Instead of studying, Jeff is watching football.
After a while Jeff deicided to study for his midterms  and the go to sleep. Jeff got really good sleep for the first time in a long while. He then continued to study and sleep until his exams on which he did well on all of them. Afterwards, he decided to watch football again.
Later that day, Jeff was leisurely enjoying the Packer game, as he always did, when he got a notification on his phone. It was an email titled "Recent Canvas Notifications." His midterm grade was in. He crossed his fingers and opened up Canvas, praying that his efforts had paid off.
